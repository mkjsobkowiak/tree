Test scenarios:
1) Create node from root
	Expected behaviour: New node should be created with 0.0 value
2) Create node from root with name: 33
	Expected behaviour: New node should be created with 0.0 value
3) Create node from root with name: test
	Expected behaviour: New node should be created with 0.0 value
4) Create 4 nested nodes from root and rename left value: 33
	Expected behaviour: Leaf should has 0.0 value
5) Create 4 nested nodes from root and rename second and thrid value: 33
	Expected behaviour: Leaf should has 66.0 value
6) Create 4 nested nodes from root with 5 leafs (from last node) and rename second and thrid value: 33
	Expected behaviour: All leafs should has 66.0 value
7) Remove root
	Expected behaviour: You should see only collapsed root
7) Create 4 nested nodes from root and remove second node
	Expected behaviour: Expected nodes should be removed
